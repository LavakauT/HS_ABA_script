## Simple guide for this scripts
```
  1. The scripts Script_1.R to Script_5.R generate most of the main and supporting figures.  
  2. Notes at the beginning of each R script indicate which figures can be generated by that specific script.  
  3. The folders f1 to f6 follow the original data storage sequence and are not related to the figure order.
